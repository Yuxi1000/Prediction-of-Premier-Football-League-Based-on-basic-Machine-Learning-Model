    "\n",
    "The aim of our project is to estimate the outcome of every single match in the 24-25 season of the premier league. In this project, we used methods from machine learning to accomplish our goal, such as Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Cross-Validation. We used data of matches from previous seasons to train our model. More importantly, we scrape real time result of the matches in the current season  in order to update our model. The prediction result should be more accurate as the season goes on."

    "We got our inspiration from in-class example (make prediction of the match between DUKE and UNC).We have found a football match predictin code from Github, however, the methods it used are complex for us. So we decided to get some infomation from AI Perplexity. We used references from Perplexity to make a basic outline of the sequence of steps we are going to take and the type of dataset we are going to grasp. "

    "According to our code, Mancheter CIty will win the trophy this season and Ipswich Town, Wolvehampton Wanderes and Southampton will relegate. But we have not taken the transfer maket this winter into our consideration since it will begin at January 2025. So there will be some difference with the real result when the season end at 2025 June."

    "\n",
    "This model is about football game match prediction, but it can be modified and used in other areas where need prediction and estimation. Our job is similar to some departments in sports analysis company such as ESPN and SkySports. Given that this is a small-sized project, there are still some improvements we can make. For example, teams’ total yellow card and red card number , stadium condition and weather can be also considered in the model to achieve higher accuracy. Our group members will keep on gaining knowledge in the field of Data Science. Through this project we had a better understanding of what Data Science can do. This project allowed us to apply what we have learnt in lectures to real life."
